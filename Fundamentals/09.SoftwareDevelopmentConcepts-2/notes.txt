Software development concepts #2

DOM  -> document object model
	-> DOM API allows changing the DOM from JS
! AJAX -> asynchronus javascript and xml
	-> used to change only one piece from the page without refreshing
! RESTful APIs are HTTP-based Web services that return small amount of needed information
	-> (GET POST PUT DELETE) (retrieve create modify delete) data
Template engines -> render data as HTML through a template
	-> React, Vue, Angular
	-> have specific syntax
	-> dynamically render and generate html
!!!! CREATE A PROJECT -> API -> server request response [ github.com zahariev-webbersof -> https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof/python-fundamentals-01-2024/blob/main/Fetching%20GitHub%20User's%20Repositories%20Information.md ]

GUI -> provide forms, dialogs and UI controls for desktop and mobile apps
	-> Windows Forms, XAML, WPF, (Qt?)
Libraries provide components/functionallity/ ui controls for integration into existing apps
Frameworks provide a base/foundation which developers extend to build an app

React is a powerful JS library used for building Web UI using HTML CSS AND JS
	-> Modern UI/dynamic
Hybrid mobile apps -> Cordova
React Native is using maily JS and a small amound of the code to be written in React

Back-end technologies are about server-side programming
!!!! Data management technologies and ORM frameworkds\

!!!! REST API frameworks, reactive APIs

!!!! Microservices, containers and cloud
	-> Hard for beginners to get
Back-end developers work on the server-side
	-> business logic, APIs, data processing, data storage

Relational databases (RDBMS)
	-> tables + relationships
	-> MySQL, PostgreSQL, Web SQL
NoSQL databases
	-> holds collections of documents or key-value pairs
	-> MongoDB, IndexedDB
!!!! Object-relational mapping frameworks
	C# -> Entity Framework
	Java -> Hibernate
	JS -> Sequelize

!!!! MVC -> Controller (handles user actions, updates the model and renders the UI view)
       Model holds the app data
       View displays the UI, based on the model data
Web MVC framewordks are used build Web applications
	Controllers handle HTTP GET / POST and render a view
	Views display HTML AND CSS 
	Models hold app data for views prepared by controllers
!!!! ASP.NET MVC Example
!!!! Small project to build a web app -> Add student, Display students

Virtualization and Cloud 
Virtualization == running a virtual machine VM 
Cloud == computing resources, vms, storage, platforms and software instances, available on demand
	-> IaaS (inftastructure as a service) - virtual machines on demand
	-> PaaS (platform as a service) - app development environments
	-> SaaS (software as a service) - software instances, e.g. Office 365\
Container image == software packed with its dependencies, designed to run in a virtual environment (like DOcker)
	-> e.g. WordPress instance (Linux + PHP + Apache + WordPress)
	-> Simplified installation, configuration and deployment
Docker is the most popular containerization platform
	-> Runs containers from local image or downloaded from the Docker Hub online repo
	-> Open-source, runs on Linux, Windows, Mac
 
!!!! Container is an independent package
	-> They rationalize a process for installing and configurating or importing an app
	-> Save resourses and time !!!!

!!!! Linux shell commands or windows powershell learn when is interesting
!!!! freecodecamp.com cmd commands INTERESTING shell commands
