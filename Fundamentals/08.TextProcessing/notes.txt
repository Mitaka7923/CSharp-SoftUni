String manipulation - Text processing

!!!! String concatenation is a slow operation because it executes the first operation and saves it into memory => then the other and saves it into memory
!!!! [[["first"] + ["second"]] + ["third"]]

!!!! string name = "Gosho" -> immutable
!!!! can be read and used but cannot be modified partially

!!!! immutable
!!!! reference type -> acts like a value type
!!!! always assign result after string operations

!!!! Important methods
IndexOf -> start of searched word. if string.empty -> 0 if doesn't exist -> -1
Contains
LastIndexOf
Reverse
Concat

Substring -> retrieves a string from a string, whether we deside the lenght or it will get it until the end of the string

!!!! StringBuilder is a class and keeps a buffer space allocated in advance -> better performance
!!!! Stopwatch -> Literally a stopwatch
